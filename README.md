# Clio_API

Simple API Client for Clio

## General Info

> **Note**<br />
> Currently unmaintained/abandoned<br />
> Originally started building for use in projects at my employer, which now uses a more universal tool for exporting data. Thus, there's no incentive/need to continue development on this.

This project is an API client to help extract data from [Clio](www.clio.com) via their [API](https://app.clio.com/api/v4/documentation).

Currently the primary endpoints built out are `/users` and `/calendar_entries`.

## Dependencies
